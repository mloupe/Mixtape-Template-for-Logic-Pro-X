# Mixtape-Template-for-Logic-Pro-X
# About
This is a super rudimentary template, but I made it for a friend to help him get his rap vocals to sit nicely with the instrumental track (aka beat). He was super appreciative, so I decided to post it online to see if anyone else may find such a thing useful.

Note also that, in this context, "Mixtape" means rapping over a pre-produced beat... similar to Lil Wayne's Dedications. See definition #6 for mixtape on urban dictionary.

# Installation
Download this template and save it to ~/Music/Audio Music Applications/Project Templates
(where ~ is your user directory)
Then, in Logic, go to File > New From Template and click on the Mixtape template


# On the Vox channel strip:
Set the first compressor’s threshold so the gain reduction averages around -5db. 
Set the second compressor so the gain reduction averages around -3db to -5db.
Play around with the highpass filter so the vox sounds natural, but not boomy.
Mix volume to taste.

# On the master bus:
Set the compressor threshold so the gain reduction averages around -2db.



# Other:
You may want to EQ a wide band cut at 500hz on the beat’s track to leave some space for the vocals.
I really like to mix with a spectrum analyzer. I’ll look at the analyzer of the master track and set the vocals so that frequencies of the vocals fit nicely with the rest of the mix.
